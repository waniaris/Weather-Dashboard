# Weather Dashboard

## Short Description

This project produces a Weather Dashboard that utilizes the [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) API with the goal: when the user enters a location, the application converts it to a latitude and longitude, then makes a second API call to retrieve the current and 5-day forecast weather for that location.
